How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Check what have been changed. Changes is the source of the problem.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Can know what have been done. Avoid missing any information and I can learn from the history of what doing good, what doing bad.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: if choosing good, can help good history for easy look up; 
    Cons: if choosing badly, will not effective and it may damage the workable code

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    It is really needed. Each commit need to be a workable copy which is comprised by a number of files

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Get the commit id in git log and then use it in git diff

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Can move to any time point of the code so that new changes can be fall back

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Creating local repository and work on my own code
